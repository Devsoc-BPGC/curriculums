 _This is a small OOPs Playlist by Bilal Khan, who is one of the best android developer YouTubers you can find nowadays._

 The video playlist is very exhaustive and industrial level, and is bit intimidiating for beginners. I recommend skipping the following parts : Delegation, singleton, sealed classes, extension and scope function.

Knowledge of Object Oriented Programming is necesary for every Developer and these concetps are universal to all OOP Languages.
   
  - Follow the Object Oriented Knowledge Module from the Native Android Track 

## Getting Started with Dart 
- So flutter is a framework written in Dart Language, so before we start developing in flutter we must learn how to code in Dart. 
- Some links to resources for Dart Programming are:
- [Dart Documentation](https://dart.dev/guides) - These are the official Dart Documentation.
- [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/?) - DartPad is an online playground where you can type and run your code on you web browser.
